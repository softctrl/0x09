In many cases, we need to perform calculations on whether a particular IP address is in a certain range , playing the role of a rudimentary firewall.

Several times complex algorithms are made to solve this problem . An IP address can always be treated as a numerical value before saving it in my database. Now we can perform selects query the type :
&nbsp; &nbsp; SELECT * FROM TBL WHERE IP BETWEEN 3232235530 AND 3232235774
Or selects like this :
&nbsp; &nbsp; SELECT * FROM TBL WHERE IN IP ( 3232235530, 3232235774 )

So let's get to it.

I IPV4 address has 4 octets , each octet containing 1 byte in size, which gives a total of 32 bits in size ,

As each byte of the size of byte, each byte can go from 0 (00000000 in binary) to 255 (11111111 in binary) , or 256 possible values ​​in each octet.

11111111.11111111.11111111.11111111

Knowing that, we have the positions of each octet ,

Thus to calculate a numeric IP value simply proceed as follows:


The numerical value of the IP address 192.168.0.110 can be obtained by

192 * (256 ^ 3) + 168 * (256 ^ 2) + 0 * (256 ^ 1) + 110 * (256 ^ 0) =
192 * (16777216) + 168 * (65536) + 0 * (256) + 110 * (1) = 3232235630

The reverse process is nothing more than changing the base number of the number found to binary , separate the octets and change the binary value to decimal value of each octet . in other words

3232235630 =&gt; 11000000101010000000000001101110 =&gt;
11000000.10101000.00000000.01101110 =&gt;

Which finally returned to the same IP:

192.168.0.110</div>
